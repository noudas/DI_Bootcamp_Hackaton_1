# Jonathan and Gilan
1. Your hackathon project is exellent! The code is well-structured, clean, and readable. The idea is well-thought-out, and the execution and results are great.
2. I liked that you weren't afraid to use modules and Python functionalities that we didn't learn in class. That shows initiative and is a great quality for a developer!
3. From your code and comments, I can tell that you clearly understand what you've done and how you've done it.
4. I also liked how you strive to make your code more structured and dynamic, such as by creating separate files for each step in the code or implementing execution functions for the database so your code will never repeate itself.
5. However, with all those files, I think you could organize them better. For example, test files are not really relevant when you're pushing/deploying a finished result.
6. Kol Akavod you did a wonderfull job!
